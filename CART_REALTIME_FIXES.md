- ✅ **After:** Real-time updates without refresh

### **Issue 3: 500 Internal Server Error**

- ✅ **After:** All cart operations work smoothly

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### **1. Backend Cart Controller** (`backend/controllers/cartController.js`)

#### **Problem:**
Cart responses didn't include populated product details after updates.

#### **Solution:**
```javascript
// Added .populate() before sending response
await cart.populate('items.product_id');
res.json(cart);
```

#### **Changes Made:**
- ✅ `addToCart()` - Now populates product details
- ✅ `updateCartItem()` - Now populates product details
- ✅ `removeCartItem()` - Now populates product details
- ✅ Added error logging for debugging

---

### **2. Cart Routes** (`backend/routes/cartRoutes.js`)

#### **Problem:**
DELETE route didn't support product_id parameter.

#### **Solution:**
```javascript
// Added parameter route
router.delete('/:product_id', cartController.removeCartItem);
```

#### **Changes Made:**
- ✅ Added `DELETE /:product_id` route
- ✅ Kept backward compatibility with `DELETE /` 

---

### **3. Frontend Cart Slice** (`frontend/src/redux/cartSlice.js`)

#### **Problem:**
`calculateTotals()` assumed product_id was always populated and only checked `price` field.

#### **Solution:**
```javascript
calculateTotals: (state) => {
  state.totalQuantity = state.items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + (item.quantity || 0), 0);
  state.totalPrice = state.items.reduce((sum, item) => {
    if (!item.product_id) return sum;
    // Check both sellingPrice and price
    const price = item.product_id.sellingPrice || item.product_id.price || 0;
    return sum + (price * item.quantity);
  }, 0);
}
```

#### **Changes Made:**
- ✅ Null checks for `product_id`
- ✅ Checks both `sellingPrice` and `price`
- ✅ Default values to prevent NaN

---

### **4. Product Detail Page** (`frontend/src/components/products/ProductDetail.jsx`)

#### **Problem:**
Product data wasn't refreshed after adding to cart, so stock numbers stayed the same.

#### **Solution:**
```javascript
const handleAddToCart = async () => {
  // ... add to cart
  
  // Refetch product to get updated stock
  await fetchProduct();
  
  // Reload products list to keep it in sync
  dispatch(loadProducts());
  
  // Reset quantity to 1
  setQuantity(1);
  
  showToast('Added to cart!', 'success');
};
```

#### **Changes Made:**
- ✅ Added `useToast` hook for notifications
- ✅ Refetch product after adding to cart
- ✅ Reload products list to sync everywhere
- ✅ Reset quantity to 1 after successful add
- ✅ Show toast notifications instead of alerts
- ✅ Updated price display to use `sellingPrice`

---

### **5. Product Card** (`frontend/src/components/products/ProductCard.jsx`)

#### **Changes Made:**
- ✅ Updated to display `sellingPrice` if available
- ✅ Shows multiple image sources (`image_url` or `images[0]`)
- ✅ Better stock display formatting
